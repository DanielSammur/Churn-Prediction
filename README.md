Customer churn — when customers stop using a company’s services — represents a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using machine learning models, allowing the company to act proactively to retain customers.

# Business problem 

Recently, the operations manager at the telecom company "Tellecom" reached out to me with an urgent concern: the number of customers canceling their subscriptions (churn) had been increasing significantly over the past few months.

He reported that the churn rate had exceeded 25% during certain periods, directly affecting the company’s revenue and customer base growth.
The challenge was clear — understand why customers were leaving and identify patterns that could predict churn before it happened.

- Understand the main factors influencing customer churn.
- Build and compare different machine learning models.
- Select and deploy the best-performing model to predict churn efficiently.
